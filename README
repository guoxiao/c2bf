C2BF is a C compiler targeting brainfuck, written by the twisted mind of Gregor
Richards.

Like most compilers, C2BF involves a multi-step procedure. Basically, input .c
files are turned into .o files using c2bf-cc. Then, those .o files are linked
using c2bf-ld. The output binary can be stripped, and the bitwidth can be
modified, by c2bf-strip and c2bf-1to*bit, respectively.

Not all of C is supported yet, but I'm working on it. And you could be too!
Next time c2bf-cc tells you that there's an undefined generation, define it in
cc/genbf/<generation>.c :)

But overall, enjoy. This is a ridiculous project with no real purpose, so just
have some fun with it. Maybe take the abstract syntax tree generation and port
the gneration to a different esolang. Maybe change the algorithms to be more
efficient. Or maybe write the most incredible BF program ever written.

OK, not that last one. That's totally cheating. And we'll be able to tell :)
